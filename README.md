# Description

## Project

This portfolio page is a single page that contains the following sections:

- A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
- A section to display featured projects as cards in a grid fashion
- A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to get in touch

This is a creative project, and the goal is to use as many React concepts as possible within this portfolio. I have used component composition, code reusability, hooks, manage state, create forms, lists etc. I have also used some popular open source libraries that allow to have a more polished and professional looking page.
Although this is not a fully functional personal portfolio, the following goals have been achieved:
- the header has external links that take you to different social apps
- the header has internal links that, when clicked, will smoothly scroll into their corresponding section
- the landing section is filled with an avatar, name and a short bio
- the project section displays a 2x2 grid with each project rendered in a card widget
- the Contact Me form instantly validates input and provides feedback when user errors occur (when some fields are missing information, when the information is of incorrect format, when no choice has been made or when the comment is too short). A custom alert message is displayed to notify the user whether the form submission was successful or not.
